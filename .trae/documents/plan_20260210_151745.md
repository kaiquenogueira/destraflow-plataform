I will implement the requested changes to the campaign scheduling and lead filtering logic.

### 1. Reduce Scheduling Restriction (3 Hours -> 10 Minutes)
I will modify both the backend validation and frontend interface to enforce a minimum 10-minute lead time for scheduling campaigns.

-   **Backend (`src/actions/campaigns.ts`):**
    -   Update `createCampaignSchema` to include a `.refine()` validation on `scheduledAt`.
    -   The validation will ensure the date is at least 10 minutes in the future from the time of submission.
-   **Frontend (`src/components/campaigns/campaign-form.tsx`):**
    -   Update the `minDate` calculation to `new Date() + 10 minutes` (formatted for the datetime-local input).
    -   Update the client-side Zod schema to match the backend restriction, providing immediate feedback to the user.

### 2. Filter Leads Already in Campaigns
I will modify the lead fetching logic to exclude leads that are currently associated with active campaigns.

-   **Backend (`src/actions/campaigns.ts`):**
    -   Update `getLeadsForCampaignSelection` function.
    -   Add a `where` clause to the Prisma query to filter out leads.
    -   **Filter Logic:** Exclude leads where `messages` contains any entry linked to a campaign with status `SCHEDULED` or `PROCESSING`.
    -   This ensures leads currently involved in an active or scheduled campaign are not listed for selection.
